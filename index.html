    <h2>Javascript Soundsmith Player</h2>
    <p>
    This is a 100% javascript Soundsmith Player.  Soundsmith was a music program
    released in the late 80s for the Apple IIgs.  Many games and demos used
    Soundsmith for their music.  I've included some examples with the player.

    <p>
    Earlier FTA software didn't use Soundsmith. I've built a specialized player
    specifically for them.

    I have included some quick-and-dirty command-line tools to extract
    music from FTA demos and other sources inside the extract/ folder.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have documented how I used those tools to reverse engineer demo
    organization and extract music in the docs/ folder.  In particular,
    the <a href="docs/modulae.html">Modulae demo</a>,
    the <a href="docs/xmas.html">Xmas demo</a>, and the
    <a href="docs/nucleus.html">Nucleus demo</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have also documented how the Apple IIgs Ensoniq DOC works, as well as pseudocode
    on how the Soundsmith player works.  You can read about it
    <a href="docs/player.html">here</a>.
