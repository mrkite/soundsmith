# Javascript Soundsmith Player

Soundsmith was a music program released in the late 80s for the Apple IIgs.  It
was used by many games and demos for their music.  This is an implementation of
the Soundsmith player written in Typescript.

You can check out a live demo [here](https://seancode.com/soundsmith).

`src/` contains the sourcecode for the player.

`extract/` contains a bunch of commandline tools I wrote to help extract music
from demos and other software.

`docs/` contains documentation on how Soundsmith works, as well as documentation
on how I extracted music from the trickier sources.

I've also included a second special music player that can play older FTA music, like the
sort found in the Nucleus demo.
